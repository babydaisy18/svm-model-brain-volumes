MTL_Asym_CrossVal.py

Input: Brain Volume Asymmetry indices for 92 patients 

Objective: Predict lateralization for medial temporal lobe based on brain volume asymmetry indices using SVM.

Process: I used scikit-learn to create the SVM model. I cross-validated and plotted the results for the ROC curve and AUC. I used the attribute coefficients/weights to determine variable importance.
